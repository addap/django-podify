Problem:
    FileResponse, with as_attachment=True and filename set would not open a save dialog when args was simply a string
    instead, args needs to be an opened file then it works
    Or do it with manually setting Content-Disposition but then that's probably the same as a normal HttpResponse with that
    header set.

Follow up Question:
    What is a streaming http response?
Answer:
    If files are very large you can stream them to the browser (e.g. Videos). The documentation says you should avoid
    this with django since the streaming response ties up a worker for the entire duration of the download.
    Since my file responses are so small it should hardly matter.

Problem:
    The rss feeds I generate using the syndication framework are always downloaded as an attachment. Why is the
    attachment header set to true? Maybe I want to view it in the browser.

    The third answer should also work since it should do the same thing.
