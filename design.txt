Since I have very limited storage space I only download episodes onto the raspberry pie temporarily. In order to signal to the django app which episodes I'd like to download onto my phone soon I use empty sentinel files which the episode url in the feed points to.
When the app registers a download of such a sentinel file it can download the actual episode off YT.
When the download is finished the app sends me a telegram message over their web api. Then I can redownload the file in my podcatcher.
