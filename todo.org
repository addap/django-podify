* DONE: Check integrity of mp3 using
ffmpeg -v error -i not_DSL_macros_-_Christophe_Grand.mp3 -f null -
from https://superuser.com/questions/100288/how-can-i-check-the-integrity-of-a-video-file-avi-mpeg-mp4 
just do it until I find another faulty one 

* DONE: Don't download webm encoded videos, my podcast app and the internal android music player cannot skip to a specific timecode with these files. Use mp4,m4a etc instead
* DONE: try-except around downloading of youtube video


* TODO: implement logging
* DONE: use django's builtin rss generator

* DONE: try out domain-less url in enclosure. my podcatcher seems to be able to find the thumbnail using only the /media/... part
        Does not work, probably because the enclosure url can be an arbitrary url that does not need to belong to the same url

* TODO: look at generic view object_detail, object_list

* DONE: Delete files when podcast/episode is deleted
        Using pre_delete signal to delete everything

* DONE: cache-control headers in rss response so that firefox doesn't cache them. Content-type can be controller by setting
        the content_type field in my feed generator but for the cache-control head I probably need to write a new view
        that instantiates that generator, generates a feed and then sends it using HttpResponse where I can set the headers.
        harmontown uses: Cache-control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private, max-age=0

* DONE: add ignored-episodes list so that episodes that are in a playlist but are no longer available/I deleted them in the admin panel do not get put into the episode list again during an update
        Not easily possible to have list fields with sqlite, instead just add an invalid flag to episode. But not a great
        solution either because now I have to filter them out every time. I should just delete them since invalid videos
        in a playlist are filtered out by pafy automatically
* DONE: Make it so I can add extra urls to a playlist podcast. Then the YT_PLAYLIST choice becomes moot and together with the ignored-episodes I should just use a urls list as the central object
        Podcast is now unified. It wasn't a good abstraction to begin with

* DONE: deploy on my raspberrypi using lighttpd or apache
	apache config in /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
	In the end I did it like https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-django-applications-with-apache-and-mod_wsgi-on-ubuntu-14-04#configure-apache
	but apparently the difficulties I had earlier when using the django documentation were a result relative paths when reading the api key and had nothing per se to do with apache
* DONE: generate new secret key and put it in separate file like api key

* DONE: add form to create podcasts with
** DONE: folder with mp3s
** DONE: playlist url
** DONE: extract description, images and more from the mp3s


* DONE: make invalid a read/write field (OR save youtube-id upon deletion so that they do not get readded in the next update)
        But I don't hve a listField field for a model. The only way I know would be with another invalidEpisode class that has podcast as a foreign key
        and that just would not be nice
        Decided to just make invalid field writable for now

* DONE: write tests
    - add podcast
    - update podcast
    - download podcast (preferably small files)
    - delete podcast
    - check generated rss
** TODO update tests, they probably don't work anymore

* TODO fix headers for media file responses. atm Firefox and my podcast app cannot stream them
because it does not send the mime type I think. At least that's what firefox was complaining about
* TODO add sync scheduled task by default (as a migration)
